## What can you do with it?

Here are some awesome things people have built using Ohm:

- [Seymour][], a live programming environment for the classroom.
- [Shadama][], a particle simulation language designed for high-school science.
- [Slang][], a browser-based audio programming language, and [turtle.audio][], a music sequencer inspired by turtle graphics programming.
- [Simpletalk][] is an expressive, programmable authoring system inspired by Hypercard and Smalltalk. _(See also the [StrangeLoop talk][simpletalk-talk])._
- [Wildcard](https://www.geoffreylitt.com/wildcard/), a browser extension that empowers anyone to modify websites to meet their own specific needs, uses Ohm for its spreadsheet formulas.
- [JAMScript][] is a programming language for edge-based IoT applications.
- [Bruno][] is an open source IDE for exploring and testing APIs.
